Hi, My name is {firstname} {lastname} and I would like to be added as a contributor.

I would like to contribute to making the NodeSchool community a more enjoyable place to 
learn and create.  I want to help by creating a Workshopper or by enhancing other Workshoppers.

I will also follow the organization's [Code of Conduct](http://nodeschool.io/madison/#code-of-conduct).
